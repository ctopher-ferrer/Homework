The image above always makes me laugh especially in stressful situation. 
It makes me reflect on my current situation and priortize what I need to do in order to "extinguish the fires".
Sometimes it helps to laugh and realize that things can/will get better but if you get too down or stressed out,
the path will be rougher.
